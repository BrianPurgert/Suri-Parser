Unique Identification (UID) is a system of distinguishing one object from another. UID of items requires that qualifying items have a data matrix inscribed either directly on the item or on a permanent machine-readable label affixed to the item. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a method of remotely storing and retrieving data using devices called RFID tags/transponders. An RFID tag is a small object integrated with a silicon chip, such as an adhesive sticker, that can be attached to or incorporated into a product. RFID tags contain antennas to enable them to receive and respond to radio-frequency queries from an RFID transceiver. RFID allows for individual items to have a unique identifier and can identify many items at once. RFID enables consumer packaged goods companies, retailers and other industries to improve their operating efficiency throughout their supply chains."
